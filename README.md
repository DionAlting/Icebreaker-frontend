We are just four students of Codaisseur, as a part of final group project we matched to deliver a project based on socket-io in four days. The idea behind this real time game app was inspired by an introduction game students play on the first day of the Codaisseur bootcamp in order to **Break the ice**.

You can go straight to our website [Ice-Breaker](https://ice-breaker.netlify.app/).

### How we work as a team:

- We started with wireframe, main structure of the app based on styling.
- We coded all together using Live Share vs-code extension.
- The communication was through discord and we worked remotely.
- We used GitHub (workflow) version control with CI/CD.

### Technology and Tools:

- ReactJs
- Redux
- Nodejs
- Sequelize as ORM
- Express
- Socket.io
- Tailwindcss
- Git
